# slox

An interpreter for the Lox language; see https://craftinginterpreters.com/

Note that this is not a conforming implementation: I have added a few things that I thought would be fun or interesting to do, such as `unless` statements and assorted extra semantic analysis. Implementations of most of the Challenges are also included (anonymous functions probably being the most prominent), which are not included in the reference implementation.
